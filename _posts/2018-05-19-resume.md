Self Evaluation：

i like english since i was at middle school but have no chance to use english before i go to work ,

after I entered the IT industry , Just one thing i keep my mind is to study english maybe one day you will work it .

yes , now i read english books and finding information to build project Development environment ,

I usually browse website such as spring.io & dubbo.io & github.com to find Learning materials , i like playing bastkeball 

and i like watching U.S. drama&Japan. drama so i learning english & japanese to enchace my language skills. 

My favorite book is the kite runner was wirtten by Khaled Hosseini. i learn a lot form this book ,i hope this world peaceful and 

happies.when i was in tourble i will try my best to get it down and when you foucs on one thing you think it is impossble and then i

completed half , so keep going and never give up to finsh it . stay hungry stay foolish .
